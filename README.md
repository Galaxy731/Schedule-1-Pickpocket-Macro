Macro to auto pickpocket in schedule 1!


-- How to use -- 

F1 - Enable/Disable script.
e - Enter minigame / move to next stage on script.
Click the green box you want to pickpocket from.

Macro will hit space as soon as the arrow is under the green box you click


-- NOTES --

This macro is depedant on pc specs and FPS, it will work most of the time when fps is ~90+
To minimize error, click the green box when the arrow is furthist away and before the arrow picks up too much speed.

This might now work for you if your pc doesnt reach higher fps or if you are capped at 60.

To get a sense of what works, i have a i7-10700kf with a 3070ti and 32 GB ram leaving me ~90fps. When pickpocketing $1000 worth items, the script will work about 80% of the time. 


-- How it works --

This macro is made in c++,
It is toggled by f1, when e is pressed it waits for your click onto the green box you want to pickpocket. When a green box is clicked, 
the macro will figure out the dimentions of the box, and then take the middle of the box, goes a bit down and waits for the white arrow 
to come into view. Then it presses space.
